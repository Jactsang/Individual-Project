# Hello, there!

This is my first personal website I built up after studying in a bootcamp for software engineering.

Here is the link:
https://jactsang.github.io/Personal-Website/

The concept of the website is introducing myself by using time machine. The layout is presented in retro-style with elements of neon lighting and old-fashioned TV programmes and more. I hope that it would bring unique experience to the visitors and immerse them in the memory of old days.

## What can you do with the website?

1. Scroll Down
    - If you keep scrolling down the website, you will experience the whole journey from the landing session with greeting, timeline of my story and contact details sequentially.

2. Navigation Bar
    - You might notice that there is a timeline sticked at the top right corner of the website. It provides all links to each part of the website. If you would like to quickly go to a particular part, you may prefer to click on the links instead of scrolling up or down for searching the part where you would like to go.

3. Play Button
    - If you see a 'Play' button (which looks like a triangle), it means that you can click on the button and see the hidden event attached to that button. There are 3 'Play' buttons for now.
